# Observer pattern

This pattern is one of the most know design patterns, the idea is to have a `Subject (that is going to be an object)` and a series of `Observers (this ones are objects as well)`, when the data in the `Subject` gets updated we are going to run a callback function for each `Observer` passing the updated data.
